## Features  

*** 

Users of the app are presented with a list of employees, currently pulled from an api. Users can then search for first or last names to filter the list, or click on the 'sort' button to toggle the alphabetization of the employee list by last name.

### Challenges encountered  
This project helped me become familiar with setting up a React application. It helped me understand the relationship between components and how data can be manipulated and used by components to change state.


### Where credit is due  
This project relies on a React app architecture, and a lightweight Milligram CSS framework. In addition it uses the Random User api to generate a list of fake employees with contact information.

### How to contribute
